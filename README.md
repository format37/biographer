# Digital Biographer

## Project Overview

Digital Biographer is a privacy-first local AI-powered conversation system designed to preserve and capture the subjective essence of a person through regular biographical sessions. Unlike conventional memory that exists in the minds of others, this project aims to create a comprehensive digital representation of an individual's inner world, thoughts, and perspectives.
